# Advent of Code - 2020

These are my personal submissions for the [Advent of Code - 2020 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/). This year, I decided to use Python.

`bootstrap` just contains some basic code and files for I to bootstrap all the challenges. `dayX` contains my resolution, input data, and algorithm analysis for that day's exercise. Feel free to use, study or rant about my code; just be aware that you're not gonna find any super efficient, fast or sometimes even clean code here.

I publish the code a day after the challenge was released, to ensure my code isn't used to get an unfair advantage on that day, or something like that.
